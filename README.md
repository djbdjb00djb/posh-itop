A PowerShell wrapper for Combodo's iTop CMDB

Requirements:

- POSH-MySQL
- iTop version 2.0.2 (REST API 1.1)

Notes:

This is designed to be an easy to use PowerShell wrapper for the iTop REST API.  It's currently most useful for the CMDB (Configuration Management) and Service Management modules in iTop because that's all I'm using.  It can also invoke the data synchronization routines required when automating your CMDB.
